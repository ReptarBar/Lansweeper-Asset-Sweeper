# Asset Sweeper

Asset Sweeper is a Lansweeper-themed, Minesweeper-style puzzle game where you audit a grid of IT assets. Your goal is to reveal every clean asset while correctly tagging each Rogue Asset before it causes trouble.

**How to Play**

**Reveal tiles**
Left-click or tap to reveal a tile.
Numbers show how many Rogue Assets are hiding in the surrounding tiles.

**Tag Rogue Assets**
Right-click or long-press to tag a suspected Rogue Asset.
Use tags to mark risky tiles so you do not click them by mistake.

**Use power-ups**
When the board looks risky, trigger a power-up to gain an edge.
Undo reverts your last reveal so one bad click does not end the run.

**Win condition**

Reveal all clean assets and tag every Rogue Asset to complete the scan.

If you reveal a Rogue Asset by mistake, the scan fails and you will need to start a new sweep.
